This exploratory study investigates whether transactions can be used to score individuals and local authority districts (LADs) in London for their environmental behaviours during the first six months of 2022. Further analysis is carried out to breakdown these behaviours and better understand their role in individualsâ€™ carbon emissions. A secondary analysis was conducted to see how scores and behaviours correlate with asthma prevalence across London.
